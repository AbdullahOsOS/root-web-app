#### By using gSOAP:
#### gSOAP is a C and C++ software development toolkit for SOAP/XML web services. So now the meter can send and receive requests to and from the head-end system. Also for the grid purpose, we need the meters to be able to communicate with each other, so we need a web server on each meter.
